# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:


#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
Pokemon.destroy_all

# require "faker"
# # TODO: Write a seed to insert 100 posts in the database

# 5.times do
#   new_poke = Pokemon.create(
#     name: Faker::Games::Pokemon.name,
#     char1: Faker::Games::Pokemon.move,
#   )
# end

# p "You just created #{Pokemon.count} Pokemons"
